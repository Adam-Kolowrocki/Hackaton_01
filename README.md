# Hackaton_01

In Thi Repository You will find my first hackaton project.

My project is a card game "War"

I used random module to generate lists os 10 numbers representing cards for each of two payers.

Then I've compared first form each list.
As there were two sub-projects I've made 
 - Card-War_1 - player who won the battle collects cards to his set till one have 0 cards
 - Card-War_2 - cards are on the table so game is over after 10 rounds
In every type of game the winner is the one who collect more cards.
